/// objects from integers.
///
/// This extension provides a number of getters that allow you to create
/// [Duration] objects from integers, where the integer represents the
/// duration in a particular unit of time. For example, you can use the
/// [seconds] getter to create a [Duration] object that represents a
/// duration of a certain number of seconds.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:simple_durations/simple_durations.dart';
///
/// void main() {
///   final duration = 5.seconds;
///   print(duration); // 0:00:05.000000
